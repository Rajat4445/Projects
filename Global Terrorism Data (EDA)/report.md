# Exploratory Data Analysis Project - Global Terrorism Dataset

## Overview

This project focuses on conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Global Terrorism Database. The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2019.

The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, identify patterns, trends, and insights related to terrorism activities, and visualize the data to provide a better understanding of global terrorism dynamics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), sourced from [START.umd.edu](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/). The dataset contains a wide range of attributes for each terrorist event, such as location, date, attack type, target type, weapons used, casualties, and more.

**Dataset Information:**
- Dataset Name: Global Terrorism Database (GTD)
- Source: [START.umd.edu](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/)
- Time Period: 1970 - 2019

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
- data/                          # Folder for storing the dataset
  - global_terrorism_data.csv    # Global Terrorism Database (GTD) CSV file
  
- notebooks/                     # Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and visualization
  - exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb  # Main EDA notebook
  
- images/                        # Folder for storing generated images and plots
  
- README.md                      # Project README file
```

## Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/global-terrorism-eda.git
   cd global-terrorism-eda
   ```

2. Install the required libraries using pip or conda:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb` to perform the exploratory data analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The notebook `exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb` contains the code for exploring the Global Terrorism Database. The analysis includes:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization
- Exploration of terrorism trends, locations, attack types, targets, and more

## Results and Conclusions

The analysis provides insights into various aspects of global terrorism, including trends over time, distribution of attacks by country and region, preferred attack types, common targets, and more. The conclusions drawn from this analysis can help in understanding the patterns of terrorism activities worldwide.

For detailed findings, visualizations, and interpretations, refer to the Jupyter Notebook: [exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb](notebooks/exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb).
